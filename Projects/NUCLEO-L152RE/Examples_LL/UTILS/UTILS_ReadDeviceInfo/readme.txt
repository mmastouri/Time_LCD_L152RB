@par Example Description

This example describes how to Read UID, Device ID and Revision ID and save 
them into a global information buffer.

Then UID, Device ID and Revision ID will be saved in following global variables:
- aShowDeviceID: Device identifier
- aShowRevisionID: Revision identifier (This field indicates the revision of the device. 
  For example, it is read as 0x1000 for Revision 1.0)
- aShowUIDWord0: UID Word0
- aShowUIDWord1: UID Word1
- aShowUIDWord2: UID Word2
